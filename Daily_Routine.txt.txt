Great, thanks for sharing your current habits and preferences. Based on your input, I'll design a morning routine that helps you feel more energized and productive throughout the day while also addressing your goals of incorporating physical exercise, reducing phone addiction, improving social confidence, and spending more time with family.

### Personalized Morning Routine

**1. **Wake-Up Time: 7:00 AM**

**2. **Start with Hydration (7:00 - 7:05 AM)**
- Drink a glass of water right after waking up to rehydrate your body.

**3. **Bathroom Routine (7:05 - 7:20 AM)**
- Brush your teeth and complete your usual bathroom routine.

**4. **Physical Exercise (7:20 - 7:45 AM)**
- Engage in a 25-minute physical exercise routine. Since you enjoy biking, you can start with a short bike ride. Alternatively, try a mix of light cardio and stretching exercises to wake up your muscles.

**5. **Breakfast (7:45 - 8:00 AM)**
- Have a nutritious breakfast. You can continue eating paraatha, chakuli, or dahi vada, but consider adding some fruit or yogurt for extra energy.

**6. **Mindfulness/Relaxation (8:00 - 8:10 AM)**
- Spend 10 minutes on a mindfulness activity such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or journaling. This can help you start the day with a calm and focused mind.

**7. **Creative Time/Vlog (8:10 - 8:20 AM)**
- Dedicate some time to your creative activities like making vlogs. This will give you a positive and enjoyable start to your day.

**8. **Limit Phone Usage (8:20 - 8:30 AM)**
- Avoid checking your phone right after your bathroom routine. Instead, use this time for your mindfulness activity and creative time. You can check your phone briefly before heading to work if necessary.

**9. **Preparation for Work (8:30 - 8:45 AM)**
- Get ready for work. This includes showering, dressing, and packing anything you need for the day.

**10. **Morning Affirmations/Confidence Boost (8:45 - 9:00 AM)**
- Spend a few minutes practicing positive affirmations and visualizing confident social interactions. This can help improve your confidence and social skills over time.

**11. **Family Time (if possible) (9:00 - 9:15 AM)**
- If time permits, spend a few minutes with your family before leaving for work. This can be a quick chat or having breakfast together.

**12. **Commute to Work (9:15 AM onwards)**
- Head to work, aiming to arrive by 10:00 AM if your schedule allows.

### Additional Tips:

- **Fixed Bedtime:** Try to establish a more consistent bedtime. Aim to go to bed around 11:00 PM to get at least 8 hours of sleep. A consistent sleep schedule can improve overall energy levels.
- **Physical Exercise:** Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your exercise routine as you become more comfortable.
- **Phone Addiction:** Consider setting specific times for checking your phone to reduce screen time.
- **Social Confidence:** Practice small talk and engage in conversations with coworkers or acquaintances to improve your social skills. Joining clubs or groups that interest you can also provide more opportunities for social interaction.
